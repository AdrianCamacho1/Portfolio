# Portfolio
This is going to be my portfolio entirely made from the ground-up
This site is mostly me experimenting best methods to create a unique website,
utilizing color initially, then experimenting fints, backgrounds, sizes, and more.

This website will highlight what understanding of coding I have at this point,
where the most difficulting part of building the website, and where I need to focus more on.
I've learned that when positioning any of the header's or lists of the website is where I had the most difficult arranging, and positioning the boxes,
however I have a better understanding of the variables for this situation, utilizing margins, floats, flex-direction, justifying-content spaces.

the website has more color, styles and sizes than any other site that only utilizes html and as a result it's more responsive to the viewer.
